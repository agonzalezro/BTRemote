Bluetooth Android/Arduino remote control
========================================

Here you will find the source code for arduino at
[``ardu.ino``](https://github.com/agonzalezro/BTRemote/blob/master/ardu.ino)
and for the Android application (all the rest of the files). You can download the
compiled version at
[``bin/BTRemote.apk``](https://github.com/agonzalezro/BTRemote/blob/master/bin/BTRemote.apk?raw=true).

The title of the project says almost all about the project. The ideas is
control a RC car with 2 servos (one for direction and one for velocity) using
the BT communication of one Android device.

This project is part of the OpenSeasson projects at
[Paylogic](http://paylogic.nl).


TODO
----

- Refactor java code... a long time without develop Java :D
- Improve app performance, sometimes it freezes loading BT.
- Remove extra files added by eclipse but not needed to be tracked.
